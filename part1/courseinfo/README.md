# Course Application

This is a simple React application that displays information about a course with its name, parts, and corresponding exercises. It consists of three components: `Header`, `Content`, and `Total`.

## Components

### Header

The `Header` component displays the name of the course, which is passed as a prop from the parent component `App`.

### Content

The `Content` component displays the individual parts of the course along with their respective exercises. The parts and exercises data are passed as props from the parent component `App` and rendered dynamically using JSX.

### Total

The `Total` component calculates the total number of exercises by summing up the exercises from each part of the course, which are passed as props from the parent component `App`.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start` or `yarn start`.
4. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
